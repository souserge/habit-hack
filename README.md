Habit tracking service with social motivation 📈

## Get started
  1. Install the **requirements**:
      * git
      * Python 3.6+
      * Django (`pip install django`)
  
  2. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/souserge/habit-hack.git`
  3. Contribute ^_^

### How to:
#### Run the app on your local machine
In the project dir `./HabitHack`, run `python3 manage.py startapp main`

#### Specify your name and email in git ( this is necessary for committing)
`git config --global user.email "you@example.com"`

`git config --global user.name "Your Name"`

#### Save your GH login and password in git (so that you won't have to type it every push/pull)
`git config --global credential.helper cache`


## Coding Style Conventions
**Note:** conventions are made in order to have consistency. It most of the cases, it improves readability, which is very important when a team has 16 people working together. But it's not be-all and end-all, while it's encouraged to stick to these style guides, the main thing to keep in mind is that other people will probably have to read your code, so try to make their lives easier.

### Python
We will use the standard style guide of Python - [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

In a nutshell:
  * indentation - 4 spaces, i.e. space characters.
  * naming
    * for variables: `lowercase_with_underscores`
    * for Classes: `CamelCase`
  * line length - less than 80 characters
  * strings - `'use single qoutes'`
  * imports - one import per line

I would recommend to at least skim over the guide in case you haven't worked on Python projects before.

### JavaScript & HTML/CSS
W3 Schools has a simple but quite readable style guide. These are the links:
  * [JavaScript Coding Conventions](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_conventions.asp)
  * [HTML Style Guide](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_syntax.asp) (CSS conventions are mentined at the end)
